# based on the results, we can only infer males are more likely to recommend than females
# the rest of the coefficents are not statistically significant. 

# Display odds ratios by exponentiating the coefficients
exp(coef(model))

# the odds ratios show males have 1.39 times higher odds of recommending compared to females.

# For some Logistic regression stats (Nagelkerke and pseudo R sq):
nagelkerke(model, null = NULL, restrictNobs = TRUE)

# Nagelkerke RÂ² = 0.015 (1.5%) means the model explains only 1.5% of the variation in the outcome
  # meaning it's not a strong model.
